# D3-Challenge

In this project I created a scatter plot between individuals who smoke and individuals age. Using D3 techniques I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. I
included state abbreviations in the circles.

This project was an exersise in using D3 to creat custom visualizations.
